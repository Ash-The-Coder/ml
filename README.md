# Machine Learning Practice Notebooks

Welcome to my machine learning practice repository! This collection of Python notebooks captures my journey as I explore various machine learning concepts and techniques.

## Overview

This repository serves as a learning playground for machine learning enthusiasts. Inside, you'll find notebooks covering topics such as:

- Data preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Supervised learning algorithms
- Unsupervised learning techniques
- Evaluation metrics
- Model deployment

Feel free to explore the notebooks and use them as a resource for your own machine learning journey.

## Usage

To make the most of this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/machine-learning-practice.git
   ```

## List of projects
1. Telecom churn prediction
2. Adult database EDA

## Credits.
I will have to credit the mlcourse website for providing such a good course and materials for practice
